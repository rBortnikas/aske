# Aske

Aske is a Q&A app for events of any kind, from conferences to lectures.
A live version can be found [here](https://aske.surge.sh).

It allows users to create question rooms and share them with others.

- Mobile first design.
- "Large display" mode for showing live questions on a screen in a venue.
- Individual questions can be voted on.
- Requires no registration.

This is not meant to be a real product - just a learning experience.

Aske is powered by React Socket.io and Express. Written in TypeScript.

##### Launching locally:

`npm start` to start the frontent and `node server.js` in `/server` to launch the server.

##### TODO:

- Create tests for critical functionality.
- Experiment with graphQL/Apollo.
